## Loader.getCacheAge property

`getCacheAge()` is called by hls.js to get the duration that a given object has been sitting in a cache proxy when playing live. If implemented, this should return a value in seconds.

For HTTP based loaders, this should return the contents of the "age" header.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
getCacheAge?: () => number | null;
```
